## How Do I Get Started ?
There are two ways to include JavaScript in your web page which will eventually execute those codes.

First, we can place it inside **script** tags.

```js
	<script>
		// your codes here..
		alert("Hello World");
	</script>
```

Second way is to link to a JavaScript file.

```js
	<script src="path/to/filename.js"></script>
```

NOTE: The **closing tag** is required even though we don't write anything inside it.

We can embed or incude a js file within head or body tags. But it is recommended to put it at the end of the body so that web page will load first before executing or downloading our js files.
