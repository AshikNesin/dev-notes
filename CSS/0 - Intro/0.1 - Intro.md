Style sheet languages are used to describe the presentation of structured documents, like HTML, XML, SVG, and other markup languages.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language developed to control the presentation of markup language documents.

-	Style sheets are a collection of formatting rules
-	Styles are applied to pages in the order they are found, cascading down from external to local styles.

Browsers have default styles




## Style Location

1. External Styles (external style sheets)
	
```html

 		<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"> 
	
```

2. Embedded Styles

```html
 		<style></style> 
```
	They are mainly used to overwrite external styles

3. Inline styles 

```html

		<p style="font-color:red;">Hello</p> 
	
```

	Using inline styles is discouraged
