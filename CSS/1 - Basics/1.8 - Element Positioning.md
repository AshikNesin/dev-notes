## Element Positioning

It allows you to take an element on the page and CONTROL where & how its positioned relative to things such as its starting position, other element & even the view port itself

### CSS Positioning Schemes


1. Normal Flow => Default Layout of the browser
2. Element Floating
3. Absolute Positioning 


#### Position Property


```css

position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | inherit

```

static => Normal Flow

### Relative Positioning


-	It'll PUSH the element.

-	Elements are still considered part of normal document flow.

-	It LEAVES empty space.

```css
	
	.box1{
		position: relative;
		left: 100px;
		top: 50px;
	}
```

### Absolute Positioning


-	Elements are REMOVED from normal document flow
-	Elements are placed relative to the nearest position ancestor.
-	It **doesn't** leave space

```css
	
	.content{
		position: relative;
	}

	.quote{
		position: absolute;
		top: 20px;
		left: 40px;
	}

```

NOTE: We NEED to position its parent

### Fixed Position


It is considered to be absolute positioned BUT they are always position relative to the active view-port.

They will remain in that position. No matter how the screen is resized or scrolled.

```css
	.ad{
		position:fixed;
		top: 50px;
		right: 100px;
	}
```

### z-index (Element Stacking)


It allows us to control which element is on top the others.

By default position elements will apper on top of the non positioned elements if those two elements overlap.

```css
	.quote{
		z-index:2;
	}
```
