The Box Model refers to the physical properties of an element's rectangular box. These are margins, borders, padding, and content width and height.

1. Margin => Represent the space AROUND an element & used to define space between page elements.

2. Border
	
	border-width
	border-style
	border-color

We can apply borders individually to the top, right, bottom & left.

There physical size is used when calculating the overall size of the element.

3. Padding

Padding is space added to the element inside the border.

4. width & height

	content width => ONLY content
	total element width => left border + left padding + content width + right padding + right border

## BOX MODEL CONSIDERATIONS


-	If a property is not declared, don't assume the value is 0
-	Elements often have defaut margins that you need to account for
-	A 100% width property when combined with padding & border will create elements that are larger than their parent


## Overflow

```css
	body{
		overflow:hidden; /* It clips overflow elements */
		
		overflow:scroll;

		overflow:auto;

		} 
```
